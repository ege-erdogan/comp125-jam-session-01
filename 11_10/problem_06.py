-- Problem 6 --
Assume there are two variables, k and m, each already associated with a positive integer value and further assume that k's value is smaller than m's. Write the code necessary to compute the number of perfect squares between k and m. (A perfect square is an integer like 9, 16, 25, 36 that is equal to the square of another integer (in this case 3*3, 4*4, 5*5, 6*6 respectively).) Associate the number you compute with the variable q. For example, if k and m had the values 10 and 40 respectively, you would assign 3 to q because between 10 and 40 there are these perfect squares: 16, 25, and 36.
